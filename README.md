# ROMP-VR-INTEGRATION
ROMP, Monocular, One-stage, Regression, used to guide virtual avatars with OpenVR

Utilizing the ROMP repo for the model - https://github.com/Arthur151/ROMP
Driverside, I used terminal29's Simple OpenVR Driver Tutorial, as I'd never written anything like it before - https://github.com/terminal29/Simple-OpenVR-Driver-Tutorial

ROMP is compiled in a ubuntu 18.04 docker environment, and I tested the driver on windows 10

Pretty much just a hasty slapping together of projects, thanks to the amazing research done by the ROMP team
